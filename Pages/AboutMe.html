        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <pre>
          I am a senior at Oakland University, majoring in Computer Science.
          The past couple of years, I've worked on projects in a group as well 
          as indiviually. The projects that I have done were websites and mobile 
          apps. Due to these classes/projects, I've learned multiple coding 
          languages/scripting, such as C++, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, SQL, 
          Python and Android Studios. I also learned a about SQL Server, Oracle, 
          and VB Script.</pre>
        <pre>
          I enjoy and have an interest in photography, so whenever I get 
          the chance or go somewhere with a nice scenry I try to take pictures. 
          And when my friends wants to do a photoshoot, I take their pictures 
          for them. In high school I took a couple of photography and graphic 
          design classes, where we learned the techniques and the settings to 
          use when taking pictures. After taking those classes, I learned how 
          to use Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Bridge, Illustrator, and Animation. </pre>
